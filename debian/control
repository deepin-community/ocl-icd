Description: Generic OpenCL ICD Loader
 OpenCL (Open Computing Language) is a multivendor open standard for
 general-purpose parallel programming of heterogeneous systems that include
 CPUs, GPUs and other processors.
 .
 This package contains an installable client driver loader (ICD Loader)
 library that can be used to load any (free or non-free) installable client
 driver (ICD) for OpenCL. It acts as a demultiplexer so several ICD can
 be installed and used together.

Description: OpenCL development files
 OpenCL (Open Computing Language) is a multivendor open standard for
 general-purpose parallel programming of heterogeneous systems that include
 CPUs, GPUs and other processors.
 .
 This package provides the development files: headers and libraries.
 .
 It also ensures that the ocl-icd ICD loader is installed so its additional
 features (compared to the OpenCL norm) can be used: .pc file, ability to
 select an ICD without root privilege, etc.

Description: Development files to build an OpenCL ICD
 OpenCL (Open Computing Language) is a multivendor open standard for
 general-purpose parallel programming of heterogeneous systems that include
 CPUs, GPUs and other processors.
 .
 This package provides a header file that allows an OpenCL implementation
 to build an installable client driver (ICD). With an ICD, an OpenCL
 implementation can be used by any OpenCL program without the need
 to link the program to the specific OpenCL implementation.
 .
 For building OpenCL applications, install the ocl-icd-opencl-dev package
 instead.
